# Deagle V4.1.0

## Introduction
Deagle is an SMT-based concurrent program verification tool. It is built on top of CBMC-5 (front-end) and MiniSAT-2.2.1 (back-end). The basic idea of Deagle is to integrate into the SAT solver an ordering consistency theory that handles ordering relations over shared variable accesses in the program. The front-end encodes the input program into an extended Boolean formula that contains ordering constraints. The back-end is reinforced with a solver for the ordering consistency theory.
The source code of Deagle is available on https://github.com/thufv/deagle.

## Deagle's Capability
For programs under simple memory models SC, TSO, and PSO, Deagle verifies user-defined assertions, detecting data races, memory failures (such as null pointer dereferences), and overflows.

## Installation
### Dependencies
- g++
- flex
- bison (Version 3.5.2 is recommended)
- gcc-multilib

### Building from source
Simply run
```
cd src && make
```
This generates executable target src/cbmc/deagle_exe.

Note: Higher versions of Bison may generate *.tab.h/*.tab.cpp that triggers warnings. On such occasions, please try removing -Werror from CXXFLAGS in src/config.inc.

## Usage
```
deagle_exe <input file> <memory model options> <unwind options> <specifications>
```

``<memory model options>`` includes:
- **--mm sc** : verify under SC (default)
- **--mm tso** : verify under TSO
- **--mm pso** : verify under PSO

``<unwind options>`` can be either of the following:
- **--unwind n** : unwind all loops for n times.
- **--unwindset loop_id0:n0,loop_id1:n1,...** : respectively set an unwind limit for each loop. Please run "``deagle_exe <input file> --show-loops``" to view the loop_id for each loop.

If unwind options are not provided, Deagle tries to iteratively unwind each loop until it is fully unwound. For instance, in
```
int n = 10;
while(n--) {body;}
```
Deagle unwinds it 10 times and stops.

However, in
```
while(1) {body;}
```
Deagle unwinds it over and over again and never terminates.

``<specifications>`` includes:
- **--unwinding-assertions**: generate an assertion for whether each loop is fully unwinded. This specification is strongly preferred in academic usage: if the user-defined assertion is TRUE but an unwinding assertion is violated, this TRUE result of used-defined assertion is not conclusive, indicating that one needs to enlarge the unwind limit and try again. This option is directly inherited from CBMC.
- **--no-assertions** : disable user-defined assertion (default enabled). This option is directly inherited from CBMC.
- **--datarace** : enable data race detection (default disabled). This option is freshly developed in Deagle.
- **--pointer-check** : enable null pointer dereference detection (default disabled). This option is directly inherited from CBMC.
- **--alloc-check** : enable malloc/calloc/... validity detection (default disabled). This option is newly developed in Deagle.
- **--memory-leak-check** : enable memory leak detection (default disabled). This option is inherited from CBMC but further developed in Deagle.
- **--signed-overflow-check** and **--unsigned-overflow-check** : enable signed/unsigned overflow detection (default both disabled). These options are directly inherited from CBMC.
- **--allow-pointer-unsoundness**: enable the experimental concurrency pointer analysis which might be unsound for some cases (default disabled, but enabled by SV-COMP script).

## Usage in SV-COMP

In SV-COMP, we cannot manually set an unwind option for each benchmark. Therefore, we determine an unwinding strategy, which hopefully provides reliable results for most tasks in SV-COMP benchmarks. We propose a simple static analysis algorithm to suggest an unwind limit for each loop, which can be invoked with option **--unwind-suggest** and outputs information in the form of:
```
Loop loop1.id:
  file <input_filename> line 11 function main
Suggested unwind limit: 10
Loop loop2.id:
  file <input_filename> line 12 function main
No suggested unwind limit
```
Based on the suggestion, if each loop is suggested with an unwind limit, we use **--unwindset** to set each loop to its corresponding suggested limit, under which the result is conclusive.

Otherwise, if there exists any loop whose unwind limit cannot be statically suggested, we try the following strategy:
- Step 1: Briefly (with timeout 5s) run the task without unwind options, trying to find whether Deagle can automatically fully unwind all loops. If so, we directly obtain a conclusive result.
- Step 2: If Step 1 fails to automatically unwind all loops, we use **--unwindset** to set each loop to its corresponding suggested limit (for loops whose unwind limits are not suggested, we set the unwind limit to 3). Consequently, TRUE results might not be conclusive, so that this strategy is deprecated for academic usage.

Please run script svcomp_stuff/deagle for SV-COMP usage.
